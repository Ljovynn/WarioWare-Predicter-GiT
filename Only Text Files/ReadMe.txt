This folder contains only the text files that are used for the Predicter app.

Every stage has two text files, one file that contains the pattern list,
and one that contains the attributes of the stage.

For example, Anything Goes has two text files: "AG.txt" and "AGAttributes.txt"
Since Anything Goes' pattern is 15 microgames long, "AG.txt" contains 15 lines,
where one line represents one microgame group.

"AGAttributes.txt" has two lines at the start, the first one contains the
pattern lenght, and the second line contains the farthest microgame you can reach.
I dont know the real number for endless Wario Cups, so I just chose 10000 for those.
Every other line contains the name of the groups,
Which sector the group is in (left blank for every stage other than All Mixed Up),
as well as which microgames are in the groups.
