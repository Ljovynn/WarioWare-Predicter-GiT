# WarioWare-Predicter-GiT
A program for the game WarioWare: Get it Together that can predict microgames.

The current stages the program can predict microgames for are: 
Every story stage,
All Mixed Up (up to microgame 614), 
Super Hard,
Thrill Ride,
Penny's Mix,
Remix (up to microgame 121)
Remix 2.0 (up to microgame 120)

There is also a warning text a few microgames ahead of levels where "Answer Me!" can appear, to alert the player in advance.

How to use: After choosing a stage, you can press space to go forward 1 level, Enter to go forward 10 levels, and backspace to go back 1 level.
