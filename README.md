# WarioWare-Predicter-GiT
A program for the game WarioWare: Get it Together that can predict microgames.

The current stages the program can predict microgames for are: 
Every story stage,
Every Wario Cup*,
All Mixed Up (up to microgame 614), 
Super Hard,
Thrill Ride,
Penny's Mix,
Remix,
Remix 2.0.

<sub>*Wario's All-Stars, Pyoro Time!, Back to Basics and Pyoro Double Play are not included.</sub>

There is also a warning text a few microgames ahead of levels where "Answer Me!" can appear, to alert the player in advance.

How to use: After choosing a stage, you can press space to go forward 1 level, Enter to go forward 10 levels, and backspace to go back 1 level.

Big thanks to TheoGN97 for providing pattern information on All Mixed Up, Super Hard, Penny's Mix and the story stages. Also a big thanks to
Super Mario Wiki for providing information on all the wario cup patterns (although some were not fully completed, which I fixed for this app.)

If you have any feedback to provide (more information on microgame patterns are very appreciated), contact me on Discord: Ljovynn#2602
