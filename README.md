# WarioWare-Predicter-GiT
A program for the game WarioWare: Get it Together that can predict microgames.

The current stages the program can predict microgames for are: 
Every story mode stage,
All Mixed Up (Up to microgame 608), 
Super Hard & Thrill Ride,
Penny's Mix.

There is also a warning text a few microgames ahead of levels where "Answer Me!" can appear, to alert the player in advance.

How to use: After choosing a stage, you can press space to go forward 1 level, Enter to go forward 10 levels, and backspace to go back 1 level.

-Added all story stages

-Added Penny's Mix
